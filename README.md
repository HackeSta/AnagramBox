# Background

I had never created a control in Visual Studio, even after 2 years of coding. One day while watching a quiz on TV, I saw the way they displayed an anagram of words, and taking inspiration from it, I started this as a practice project.  
It took me 2 days (1 or 2 hours each day) to finalize it. If asked I might add more features to it.
